# INSTALL

[x] Build (enclave modified) GMP library (https://github.com/intel/sgx-gmp)

Note: may need to (re)execute /home/jess/sgxsdk/enviornment for correct env vars after reinitializing

[x] Build SGX PSW
[x] Build SGX SDK 
Note: mitigation tools?
Reference: https://download.01.org/intel-sgx/sgx-linux/2.13/docs/Intel_SGX_Installation_Guide_Linux_2.13_Open_Source.pdf
